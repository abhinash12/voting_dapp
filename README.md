Creating your first basic decentralized voting application

Used:
•	Solidity
•	Ganache
•	Node.js
•	Html

Steps:

•	Write smart contract using solidity.
•	Compile the contract which generates bytecode, abi among other things.
•	Ganache gives us a blockchain network on which we could deploy the smart contract.
•	We deploy the bytecode on the blockchain.
•	After deploying we could interact from the console and run the functions we declared in the smart contracts.
•	We develop a basic web page for web interaction and we use web3 rpc calls to interact with the blockchain.
